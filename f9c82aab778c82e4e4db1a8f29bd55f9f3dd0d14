      "message": "Overall, IMO this is the wrong place for this code.  dbus-sensors is about reading hardware sensors, and pulling in TCP/http based sensors breaks quite a few things, and duplicates quite a big chunk of code that already exists in the aggregation feature, that should not be duplicated.  Reiterating what I said in the design review, this needs to be more tightly integrated with the existing features, rather than just rewriting them, given that significant effort has been put into tuning, debugging things like keepalive, supporting features HTTPS (which is technically a requirement of redfish) and other stuff that this patchset chooses to ignore.  When things like authentication, mutual TLS, and other are added, had we accepted this feature as written, we would have to duplicate those features as well, which would add significantly more engineering compared to integrating a solution in the first place.  This is roughly the same position that was taken when the aggregation feature was originally added, in that it re-implemented significant portions of EventService, so this is not feedback that is unique to this patchset.\n\nAs written, this patchset also seems to ignore some important required parts about the redfish specification, like walking the Redfish tree, ownership of the odata.id parameters, checking odata.type, error codes, handling 202 accepted, and other things.  While those could certainly be improved, it would have to start with a reading of the specification, and a rebuild of the polling loops and parameter sets to match what the specification states.\n\nIf other dbus-sensors and Redfish maintainers disagree with this opinion, I\u0027m happy to have a discussion about if this is the right place for this code, and who will maintain it.  We already have two redfish client libraries (libredfish, and http_client.hpp in bmcweb).  I\u0027m not interested in maintaining a third, especially one that\u0027s based on the same core libraries (beast/asio) as the http_client.hpp, and only implements a subset of its capabilities and specification correctness.  If we need to break that section of bmcweb out into a library, that\u0027s fine, lets get that done.",

      "message": "I am all for extricating the HttpClient feature out of bmcweb, and making it available as a library, to other interested packages such as this. However, doing this is beyond the scope of what I had originally set out to do, that is, integrate Redfish sensors into dbus-sensors. It would be worth doing as a separate project in the future, though.\n\nThe reason to use Beast and ASIO is to smoothly integrate with the existing design of dbus-sensors, which uses ASIO, and for this, it works well. The RedfishConnection class is made to intentionally be at the center of the hourglass, as the implementation of it is intentionally drop-in replaceable with another implementation (such as HttpClient, if it could be extricated from the rest of bmcweb), as I agree that using HttpClient would be preferable.\n\nI believe dbus-sensors is for reading sensors, and making their values available on D-Bus. I don\u0027t believe it needs to be constrained to hardware sensors. (To be pedantic, they actually are hardware sensors, but they are located on another machine, and so, we need to use Redfish to pull in their values over the network.)\n\nHTTPS and TLS (SSL) can be added in a future revision of this feature. I am intentionally not including it in this first release. Also, RedfishSensor works best with tightly coupled machines in a cluster, with limited access to the outside world, which is our use case. As of yet, there has been no demand for encryption between machines within this cluster.\n\nNot sure what you mean about walking the Redfish tree. The tree is walked, starting at the root, to find chassises and sensors. The odata.id parameter does need to be more consistently checked, and I have that on my to-do list, you\u0027re right.\n\nError codes are supported, and made available to callers of RedfishConnection. The odata.type field is intentionally ignored, as RedfishSensor validates the syntax at the JSON level, without parsing schema metadata. The \"202 Accepted\" result seems only to be a concern when sending a request to perform a write action that modifies state on the Redfish server, but all requests RedfishSensor sends are merely read-only in nature.",
