      "message": "This is mostly an independent issue that should probably be addressed separately, but I feel like we should go through these daemons and decide which ones should really be enabled by default.  Everything-and-the-kitchen-sink by default bloats firmware image sizes and makes our already-glacial boot times even slower; I\u0027m pretty sure zero systems that have ever existed will actually need both intelcpu *and* amperecpu, for example (and I\u0027m guessing most systems probably use less than half of them).  Maybe they should all default to disabled and we should have each platform explicitly opt-in to the specific set it actually wants?",
