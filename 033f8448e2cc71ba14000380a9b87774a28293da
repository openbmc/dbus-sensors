      "message": "I think the code change and the explanation for it both make sense.\n\nMy question: If you powered the host back on with no further changes, will thresholds be re-asserted, and the status changed back to \u0027critical\u0027 in the webUI?\n\nBased on my read of surrounding code, I believe the normal threshold behavior will be restored when PowerState-linked sensors have ThresholdTimer::startTimer called after power is restored --and that this change *will not* break normal threshold responses for affected sensors once host power is back on.\n\nCan someone with a better understanding, or hardware to check confirm that this is the case?",
