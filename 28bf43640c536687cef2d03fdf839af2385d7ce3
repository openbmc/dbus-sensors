      "message": "IMO, the old code was better.  sizeof(Threshold) looks like it\u0027s 2 enums (32 bit) 2 doubles (64 bit) and a bool (8 bit).\n\nthis copy, while not the best, is relatively cheap to make, and to my eye, as this patch written, this has a possibility that it has possibility of a use after free issue if a client changes the thresholds while a ChangeParam operation is occuring.  Making the copy means that we never have to think about a use after free issue.\n\nIf we wanted to optimize this, we could make the Level and Direction enums inherit from uint8_t to make our Threshold struct 48 bits smaller (maybe more with packing) and cheaper to copy.",
