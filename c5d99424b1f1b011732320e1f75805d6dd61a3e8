      "message": "This is not clear to me.  How does a voltage reading become a current reading?\n\nIf the sensor is actually reading volts, which you\u0027re using as a relation to a known resistor to measure current (via ohm\u0027s law), I don\u0027t really think we should have that be part of the sensor itself, but probably as part of phosphor-virtual-sensors.\n\nMaybe we could get some feedback from the maintainers here?",
