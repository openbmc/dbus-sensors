I\u0027d much rather we go more specific folders like\n\nasio\nreactor\n\nthat can match the appropriate namespaces rather than just having one common folder for everything.  Looking forward to what other people think, but blanket rearranging this when the code that\u0027s underneath it is already pretty manageable seems like a lot of effort for very little gain.",
