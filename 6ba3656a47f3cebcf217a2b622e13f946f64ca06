Such as namespaces `thresholds`, `notify_watch`, `sensor_paths`, `systemd`.\n\nThere is no common parent namespace or such. And changing that would be a bigger diff.\n\nDo you really want to have a separate directory for each namespace?\n\n\u003e but blanket rearranging this when the code that\u0027s underneath it is already pretty manageable seems like a lot of effort for very little gain.\n\nHow do you plan to solve the issue of ambiguity w.r.t. include statements?\n\nCurrently it\u0027s not clear to the reader if it\u0027s a common header or sensor specific header being included.\n\nLet\u0027s take an example from nvidia code\n\n```\n#include \"Inventory.hpp\"\n\n#include \"Utils.hpp\"\n\n#include \u003cMctpRequester.hpp\u003e\n#include \u003cNvidiaGpuMctpVdm.hpp\u003e\n#include \u003cOcpMctpVdm.hpp\u003e\n#include \u003cboost/asio/io_context.hpp\u003e\n```\n\nwhere we include `Inventory.hpp` and `Utils.hpp`. Now which of those is a common header and which of those is specific to nvidia gpu sensor? It\u0027s hard to tell.\n\nSome includes are even using inconsistent include style (brackets / quotes).",
