If time duration is negative, something is really broken in this app, and we shouldn\u0027t be clamping it.\n\nIf alpha is negative, that seems reasonable to clamp it, but we should clamp on line 838, not after the negative number has been multiplied through.\n\nSorry, i really should\u0027ve caught this the first time around.",
