      "message": "I like this idea in concept, but instead of picking a hardcoded value at the top scope and passing it through all the layers, would it make more sense to just pick a uniform random number between 0 and poll rate for each sensor and use that as the first delay?  That way, the sensors get staggered randomly based on their poll rate?  As written, because we don\u0027t take poll rate into account, if I had 100 tmp75 sensors, it would take 10 seconds for all of them to init, which doesn\u0027t seem great.\n\nAlso, that would greatly simplify this patch.",
