That check should be checking against Level::ERROR, and this variable should be removed entirely.  As-written, this only works because prior to this patch both Direction::ERROR and Level::ERROR so happen to equal 2.  Please clean that up, ideally in a separate patch, but if you want to roll it into this one, that\u0027s fine too, but regardless, as written this patchset is incorrect.",
