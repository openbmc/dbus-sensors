      "message": "Understood. The reason for removing `setValue` was that I believed it necessary to differentiate the nature of the Control::Target and Sensor::Value properties.\nHowever, if it\u0027s deemed more appropriate, I can reinstate the call to `setValue`.\n\nThe main goal of this commit is to prevent the Control::Target from being directly tied to changes in the driver PWM file, ensuring that it reflects only the value that the user has explicitly written to the D-Bus interface.\nMay I clarify, does this imply that if we use the Senosr::Value to control the PWM, the Control::Target should also adjust accordingly to reflect the change?",
