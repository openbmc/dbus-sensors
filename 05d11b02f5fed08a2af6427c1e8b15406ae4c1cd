      "message": "If we end up retaining RH, I think I\u0027d prefer that we define a new unit.  Such as \"PercentRH\" (or even simply \"Humidity\").  I don\u0027t think the ambiguity between the current \"utilization\" use of percentages and this new \"humidity\" use of percentages is a good direction.  I\u0027d like to leave \"Percent\" for non-real unit-less values and add well-defined units for those percents that are derived from the real world.  ie. Relative Humidity is only unit-less because the units cancel out in the division, but it is still pinned to those original unit definitions, so we shouldn\u0027t drop the unit in our unit-name.\n\nI think this direction I\u0027m proposing follows the direction Redfish has chosen as well, as they have defined a separate unit for Humidity vs Percent:\n\n\u003e \"Humidity\": \"This value shall indicate a relative humidity measurement, in percent units, and the ReadingUnits value shall be \u0027%\u0027.\",\n\u003e \"Percent\": \"This value shall indicate a percentage measurement, in percent units, and the ReadingUnits value shall be `%`.\",",
