      "message": "FWIW, a related issue (but with adcsensor) was already discussed at https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/37345 with many good points raised. AFAICT, the conclusion is that it\u0027s essential to set the maximum to the real maximum that ADC can measure; while with adcsensors it\u0027s possible to just hardcode it for all supported devices, psusensors needs more fine-grained approach.",

      "message": "Hello Andrew,\nSo basically here we need a way to match on two keys: the kernel driver name and the particular label. One way to do that would be to make labelMatch a map that uses `std::pair\u003cstd::string, std::string\u003e` for the key. That would involve changing all the existing entries in it, and adding new entries would look a bit more complex. The approach I offer is allowing to do the job with minimal changes, also similar \"metadata in a string\" idea was already accepted in c7e956275ffef . I do not consider the possibility to get a clash between such an augmented label name with another real label name to be real, so I can\u0027t see any downsides.",
