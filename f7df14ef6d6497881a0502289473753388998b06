      "message": "FWIW, a related issue (but with adcsensor) was already discussed at https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/37345 with many good points raised. AFAICT, the conclusion is that it\u0027s essential to set the maximum to the real maximum that ADC can measure; while with adcsensors it\u0027s possible to just hardcode it for all supported devices, psusensors needs more fine-grained approach.",
