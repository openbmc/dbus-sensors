I can also give the link from that issue to this, but I don\u0027t think this will change anything significantly.\n\nIdeally, go into the patchset in question, and point out specific lines, with specific suggestions where code could be simpler, better, or more future proof, or go to the tested statement, and point out test cases that the current patchset doesn\u0027t patch.\n\n\u003e Anyway, maintainers need to make decision on which implementation they like more.\n\nFWIW, I\u0027m the maintainer on this, and assuming both patchsets are equal, I will generally try to pick the one that has more community input, as it implies that the community has tested it better and is more interested in supporting it.  If there are significant engineering advantages to one or another that are called out, that is definitely a deciding factor in many cases.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e it would help a lot if you could quantify this more before you post on the other changeset.  \"natural\" isn\u0027t very descriptive in terms of describing engineering details.\n\u003e \n\u003e Well, saying \"more natural\" I mean this solution is like refactoring, while that more like a workaround (in Russian we call such solutions \"костыль\" (crutch) \u003d)).\n\nBut why (using technical details, variable names, and data structures from the patchset) is it better?  Ideally, this should be answered in your commit message, not in a gerrit comment.\n\n\u003e I now working on switchable threshold sets feature (allow to change thresholds when e.g. host going to standby) and this was part of the work.\n\nThis is great detail, probably a distinct advantage of this patchset, and should be mentioned in your commit message.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e In the context of this review, and 43172, lets focus on the change being made, not hypothetical features we could add later (unless this patchset directly enables those features or puts us closer to the path of enabling).\n\u003e  \n\u003e I highlight this because 43172 allow to set such thresholds, but it is impossible to save them, only keep until reboot, while this change will reject attempt to change N/A threshold.\n\nThat\u0027s also great detail, and should be in your commit message (ideally with a test case that the other patchset would fail).\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e I\u0027m happy to discuss making thresholds that didn\u0027t previously exist create-able, but not in the context of this patch.\n\u003e \n\u003e The implementation for sure is out of scope here.",
