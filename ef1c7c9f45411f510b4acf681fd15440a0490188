      "message": "This brought up another question. The purpose of `Target` versus `Value` is subtle. I think, but am not entirely sure, that there were 3 reasons:\n* `Target` is integer, from 0 to 255, so it easily maintains a 1:1 correspondence to the underlying Linux kernel `hwmon` interface (for fan PWM).\n* Being an integer, it can always be easily compared for equality without floating-point loss, which is important for the optimization of avoiding duplicate settings if the setting already matches what was desired.\n* `Target` is always read/write, versus `Value` which was always read-only until late 2021 when the `ValueMutability` feature landed.\n\nOther than these, the `Target` value is interchangeable with `Value`, IIRC. They update each other, in lockstep. Changing one, always and instantly, will change the other. At least that\u0027s how it\u0027s been, in my experience, for fan PWM.\n\nTo change the meaning of `Target` or `Value` now, to have it reflect the delayed response from the hardware instead of the user\u0027s instantaneous desired intent, might have other side effects. We might need a third field. However, this would require an interface change. The advantage of adding a third field is that it would help disambiguate all of this historical baggage, and it would help greatly for user-settable sensors, to avoid the race condition between the desired setting (flowing down from user to hardware), and the actual value (flowing up from hardware to user).",

      "message": "Thanks! Reviewed it.\n\nFYI, I also tried to find the equivalent sensor write handler in the Redfish server, `bmcweb`, but did not find it after a quick look. I\u0027m pretty sure this feature exists already, it might have been in a local patch? Regardless, the `ValueMutability` interface is intended for any situation in which there\u0027s a sensor write request coming in from an external source and we need to validate if it\u0027s allowed or not.\n\nThe important thing here is that `Value` can be written to, just like `Target`, and there\u0027s really no prohibition on the user doing so, if they have permission, so we have to handle these equivalently. I wonder if we should add additional fields, perhaps `IntendedValue` and/or `HardwareValue`, to disambiguate?",

      "message": "Maybe i am not getting the big picture here, but do we actually need a Pwm `Sensor`?\n\nThe PID loop is taking temperatures and adjusting the pwm value to control the fan speed.\n\nIf the fan speed is not reaching the requested value after some time then that\u0027s an error condition.\n\nSince the pwm is a control input which is assumed to just \u0027work\u0027 if correctly configured. So we should be able to assume it always has the correct value?\n\nLooked into the `max31790` datasheet and there they mention the delay to reflection can be up to `125ms` which i would consider to be a minor delay and probably nothing to worry about in the control loop.\n\nSince the PwmSensor looks like the interface boundary between the sysfs and the PID loop, can we just shortcut the implementation to store the pwm value internally anytime the user sets it and return that if requested?\n\nIf there is anything bypassing the PwmSensor, that\u0027s broken anyways?\n\nAnother point: concepts like \u0027Threshold\u0027 do not make sense for a control input.",

This is to ensure that the physical fans are running at the desired speed set to `Target` by phosphor-fan-control service. If this check fails, `Functional` property is set to false for fan inventory objects under phosphor-inventory-manager \u003d\u003e fan fault LED might be turned ON.\n\nIf both `Value` and `Target` show hardware value, this check will never fail. So separate implementations of the two can better adhere to their names and help in those monitoring practices.\n\nTo double check, if I intentionally set 255 to a fan that was previously controlled to be running at 150, `Value` will show the new speed and `Target` will still show 150/255, right?",
