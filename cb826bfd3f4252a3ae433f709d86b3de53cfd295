      "message": "Enabling these with wildcards will mean that on every clang version update we break when new checks are added and have to go through manual effort to either fix the build or port the checks forward.\n\nAndrew/Zhikui, were you aware of that new responsibility with this wildcard mechanism?  This isn\u0027t something I personally want to sign up fo;  I\u0027m barely able to keep up with clang updates as it is.",

      "message": "It would help quite a bit if you could document the actual diff here in terms of enabled tests.  I see tests that were previously enabled that have now been removed (even considering the wildcards), but no real justification as to why the checks were no longer valid.  It also doesn\u0027t document what checks we\u0027ve now enabled, and it\u0027s difficult to see in the way this patchset is formed.",
