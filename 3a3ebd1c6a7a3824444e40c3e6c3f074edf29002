Having a class per application seems worse.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e By having a common code we can avoid subtle bugs arising due to different order of initialization and code drift.\n\nLets be concrete when we talk about bugs.  Can you point to a bug or two of that nature that we\u0027ve had on master and needed to fix?\n\n\u003e \n\u003e From my perspective this practical concern outweighs a conceptual concern, but to each their own.\n\nio_context being outside of main isn\u0027t conceptual.  It has caused crashes on shutdown in the past (check the dbus-sensors code history for some of the fixes).",
