Are you leveraging meson subproject/wraps to do it?  I\u0027m slightly surprised that it doesn\u0027t work if you are because then both lg2 and this should be compiled with clang and use the experimental::source_location instead.  I can see it not working if you\u0027re attempting to use an SDK or something for lg2.",
