Are you leveraging meson subproject/wraps to do it?  I\u0027m slightly surprised that it doesn\u0027t work if you are because then both lg2 and this should be compiled with clang and use the experimental::source_location instead.  I can see it not working if you\u0027re attempting to use an SDK or something for lg2.\n\n\n\nNo problem, I\u0027m not in a super huge rush.  My overall goal is to get:\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/openbmc-build-scripts/+/51391\n\nmerged, which hopefully also answers how I\u0027m testing compiling with clang.  For what it\u0027s worth, I\u0027ve also pulled in meta-clang into my yocto builds, and compile with:\nTOOLCHAIN:pn-\u003crecipename\u003e \u003d \"clang\"\nin my local.conf.  Each give roughly the same results.  Sometimes yocto will find clang-specific 32/64 bitness issues, but it\u0027s pretty rare.\n\nI totally agree, this patch is a lame solution, happy to have a better one.",
