      "message": "Maybe? Is libgpiod even thread (context?) safe?\n\nI didn\u0027t look into it too much once I realized the issue was only occurring at system boot when there were a number of configuration changes each triggering a callback. I stole the timer idea here from Entity Manager, but then realized a lot of other dbus-sensor daemons have them as well. I think reducing the amount of work done for a quick succession of configuration changes is always going to be correct.",

      "message": "Hmm -- while I\u0027m not deeply familiar with libgpiod and its internals, my rough understanding is that it\u0027s a fairly thin wrapper that just issues ioctl syscalls and doesn\u0027t have much in the way of internal state to maintain, so it\u0027s not the first thing I\u0027d suspect of harboring race conditions.\n\nPerhaps relatedly, could you expand on the nature of the failures you\u0027ve seen?  (I\u0027m not sure exactly how to interpret \"sensors were failing\" absent some more detail.)",
