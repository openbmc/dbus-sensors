      "message": "Maybe? Is libgpiod even thread (context?) safe?\n\nI didn\u0027t look into it too much once I realized the issue was only occurring at system boot when there were a number of configuration changes each triggering a callback. I stole the timer idea here from Entity Manager, but then realized a lot of other dbus-sensor daemons have them as well. I think reducing the amount of work done for a quick succession of configuration changes is always going to be correct.",
