      "message": "My issue in general with the static library approach is now we take a link hit every time one of those files gets modified, and it means we can no longer do test-specific settings that are compile time (like ASAN things).  I will follow up with some quantization of timing numbers here, but I think what I have now is my preference at the moment, but I will back that up with data.\n\nExample of test-specific ifdefs in other repos:\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/libcper/blob/5a8a94f401a5535b35a2d2899f93f8dc41d0ebca/cper-utils.c#L453",
