      "message": "Mutability isn\u0027t a property of all sensors, so it doesn\u0027t really belong in this class.\n\nUnfortunately this means duplicating some of your code.  This class is already a mess an needs broken up into smaller pieces, lets no make it worse.\n\nAlso, I suspect the number of sensors that need to be made mutable is small, we can probably just do it in those cases (should be just external sensor and pwmsensor, right?)",
