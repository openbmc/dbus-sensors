That should be the preferred way going forward.\n\nWe should, for the time being, get x86-power-control to also expose the interface at state/host0 instead of state/os.  Most of the code using state/os is Intel specific and we can then port them to use the preferred one.\n\n\"state/os\" was never documented anywhere.  I don\u0027t think it should be preserved.",
