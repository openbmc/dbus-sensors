The point of this is that in the future we will likely have i2c devices that don\u0027t have a kernel backing, or we might completely bypass the kernel drivers.  The entity-manager configurations should be able to survive such a change, which this patchset I don\u0027t believe it would be able to.\n\nAlso, considering that LM63 also isn\u0027t in the new device list, it\u0027s odd that just adding this would work.",

AspeedFan was originally supposed to denote \"fan attached to the aspeed controller\" but given that there aren\u0027t that many bmc model variants, and there\u0027s a desire for config files to work across bmc boundaries (ie DC-SCM) those arguably should be combined into a single unit these days.\n\nI2cFan arguably should\u0027ve gone into its own daemon/implementation/abstraction, but the maintainer at the time thought that it was simpler that way.  FWIW, if you look at the code, it causes a lot of duplication of functionality, and causes fansensor to take a link dependency on i2c, which isn\u0027t great.\n\nAs far as why Fans and Temps are different, it\u0027s because they are fundamentally different problems being solved, and have different failure modes.  The goal of splitting them up is such that if say, hwmontempsensor fails, it doesn\u0027t take down the control of the other sensors, which makes it very easy for a user-front line programmer to triage.  For example, if all your tmp75 devices disappear on the system, it probably means that hwmontempsensor crashed.\n\n\n\n\u003e Entity-manager features scans and discovers system devices dynamically.
