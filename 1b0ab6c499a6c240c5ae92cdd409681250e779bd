      "message": "Why not just add LM63 and the others to the list?  The point of this is that in the future we will likely have i2c devices that don\u0027t have a kernel backing, or we might completely bypass the kernel drivers.  The entity-manager configurations should be able to survive such a change, which this patchset I don\u0027t believe it would be able to.\n\nAlso, considering that LM63 also isn\u0027t in the new device list, it\u0027s odd that just adding this would work.",
