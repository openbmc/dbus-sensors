      "message": "Can you please clarify whether you mean just RPM monitoring or also PWM control?\n\nThe driver referenced seems to be only allowing control via `/sys/class/pwmchip*/` interface by changing `duty_cycle` after exporting and setting `period`. I do not see any code anywhere that supports this new method and offers `xyz.openbmc_project.Control.FanPwm` D-Bus interface, can you please tell how to use it?",

Asking because there\u0027s a difference between the old out of tree code: https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/openbmc/patch/20210113070850.1184506-5-troy_lee@aspeedtech.com/ (search for `aspeed_pwm_hwmon_info` which lists the additional /hwmon/ attributes) and the current driver at https://github.com/openbmc/linux/blob/dev-6.6/drivers/hwmon/aspeed-g6-pwm-tach.c#L268 which only offers /pwmchip/ sysfs interface to the userspace AFAICT.\n\nWith the old driver we had device nodes like `/sys/devices/platform/ahb/1e6e0000.apb/1e610000.pwm-tacho-controller/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1` and that was handled nicely by dbus-sensors. But with the new driver (referenced from the commit message in the currently discussed patch) which eventually landed upstream the userspace would need to handle talking via `/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0` and I do not see any code in dbus-sensors that can do that and it didn\u0027t work in our testing.",
