      "message": "I was curious if this would be a requirement: how come everything needs to be so, dynamic? Wouldn\u0027t it be reasonable to just make sure the systemd unit deploying this process waits for entity-manager to start first, and to restart the sensor unit whenever entity-manager restarts?\n\nIs entity-manager notifying systemd that it\u0027s \"ready\" before exporting all of the objects from fru discovery?\n\nI\u0027m happy to go add a signal handler for this I guess, but it just seems like it\u0027s a lot of complexity, and I\u0027m unfamiliar with the precedence for this.",
