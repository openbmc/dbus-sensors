      "message": "\u003e So my comment was more idle musing than something actionable.\n\u003e \n\u003e However, I expect it\u0027s not worth trying to talk to an endpoint if it\u0027s not represented in the mctpd object tree. Given that instances of the classes in `src/mctp/MCTPEndpoint.[ch]pp` reflect the MCTP endpoint\u0027s lifecycle, it would seem sensible for that `MCTPEndpoint` to be able to produce one of these ASIO wrappers?\n\nMy thought there is to not impose an asio requirement for applications that didn\u0027t otherwise need it.  I could move this into something like src/mctp/asio/x.hpp just so it\u0027s common, then at least we have something common?\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Again, just musing on an possible direction, not intending to hold anything up necessarily. Maybe fixing naming does solve the problem, though I\u0027d more lean towards incorporating `ASIO` or `Socket` for this class, given they\u0027re fundamental to its implementation.\n\nI can rename, I think that\u0027s a good idea.",
