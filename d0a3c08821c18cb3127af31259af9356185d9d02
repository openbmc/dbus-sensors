      "message": "The problem statement makes sense, and from what I\u0027ve seen as I dig through surrounding code, the solution seems like it should work as expected too. I do have some mild reservations about how the threshold-Hysteresis \u00270\u0027 value is set, though.\n\nI think I would feel more comfortable with the change if it was set via a parameter (maybe with a default value?) in the function header.\n\nWhat do you folks more experienced with dbus-sensors code think?",
