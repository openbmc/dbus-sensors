      "message": "I\u0027ve tested your solution, and it looks like it is working fine. I\u0027ve only added this `break` instruction to your code snippet.\nYour solution doesn\u0027t have ugly `static_cast\u003cthresholds::Level\u003e(i)` that I have in my patchset 3.\nBut if I\u0027m correct, complexity of this approach is O(n^2) vs O(n) in patchset 3.\nI\u0027m fine either way.",

      "message": "Yes, this is N^2, but the old one was N * M on the fixed size data structures.  Considering the common case of N is 2-4, and the largest possible case of N is 8, N^2 is unlikely to matter much here.\n\nFWIW, I originally tried changing the Threshold class to include both a positive and negative component, but that got more involved than I wanted",
