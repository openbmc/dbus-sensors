      "message": "We used to have a issue that eth1 is unstable and it will make eth1 link up and down many times.\n\nDuring debug this issue we found that not only ```systemd-networkd``` will send a lot of log, but also ```intrusionsensor``` even if we have not add the NIC config for eth1.\n\nAnd then I add this change to make journal be cleaner so as to focus on the log in ```systemd-networkd``` and other journal message.\n\nThe log for ethernet in ```intrusionsensor``` looks similar as the log in ```systemd-networkd```.\n\nHowever, the log in ```systemd-networkd``` have more details, so the log in ```intrusionsensor``` is kind of duplicated to me.\n\nIt might not be required, but it can remove the unneeded log in this sensor.",
