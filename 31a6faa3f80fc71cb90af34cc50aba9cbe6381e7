      "message": "Not suggesting you change your approach necessarily, so marking this as resolved to start with.\n\nMy approach here has been to use `executable(..., implicit_include_directories: false, ...)`, and then provide an explicit list of include directories, which in this case we\u0027d constrain to `src/`. From there the `#include \"...\"` directive in each translation unit needs to use the path relative to `src/`, which helps disambiguate. I feel this is helpful because it explicitly aligns the source with the repository\u0027s file hierarchy and may remove the need to move everything under `src/common/`.",
