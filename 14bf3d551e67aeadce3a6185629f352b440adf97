      "message": "Help me out a little here.  This patchset has a number of +1s, yet has an obvious typo in the commit message, and is breaking one of the main abstractions/principals of entity-manager by putting linux DT specifics into the entity-manager config files.  The existing ADC sensor implementations are meant to point to ADCs that exist in the BMC.  If there are external devices, they would get their own Type: code, and would be matched up with the DT equivalent at runtime, but I see no mention of that here, and I see code that\u0027s just pushing more complexity into the config files, without making mention of the actual parameter in the commit message.\n\nWe try to avoid using linux-specifics in entity-manager config files because they\u0027re intended to be writable by hardware and platform engineers, that might not understand what a linux device tree name is.\n\nCan you please talk to some of these concerns in your commit message?",
