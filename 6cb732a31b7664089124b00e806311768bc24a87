      "message": "IMO we can\u0027t/shouldn\u0027t do that, as the \"name\" itself is allowed to have spaces in it.  The dbus object path is the thing that can\u0027t, and we should keep that escaping logic as close to the add_interface call as we can.\n\nThe mismatch you\u0027re noting is expected;  Also this is identical to how we do it within sensor.hpp, so I\u0027d like to be consistent unless there\u0027s a good reason not to.\n\nSaid another way, if we wanted to move where we do the do the escaping at a higher level, we should do it for all sensors, not just psu sensor.\n\nThanks for the comment!",
