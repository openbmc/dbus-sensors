The fact that nobody replied for a month might just be due to developers not having a strong opinion here?  I\u0027m going to take that stance, because the alternative (nobody cares enough about these interfaces or Jagpal maintaining them) doesn\u0027t sound great to me and would imply we\u0027ve done something wrong.\n\nFWIW, I keep a prioritized list of reviews, and if nobody has reviewed something, it falls lower on the list for me personally.   Keep in mind, there are currently listed 4 top level maintainers in dbus-sensors (was 5 until recently), but most of them are absent.  Thats something we need to clear up at TOF level, but arguably this new maintainer decision should\u0027ve been driven by consensus and not \"does Ed think this is a good idea\" which seems to be what\u0027s implied.",

Hence, we need to be careful about how we abstract them. Having said that, this is a topic for future discussion when we will evaluate this refactoring, so i am marking this as resolved.",
