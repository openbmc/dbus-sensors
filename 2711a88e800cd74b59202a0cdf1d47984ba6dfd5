And make this url in redfish return not found when battery sensor trigger the threshold or the sensor reading is not available.\n\u003e \n\u003e With respect, that\u0027s against Redfish best practices for how trees should be structured and how the API should work.  If the battery is unavailable, it needs to be returning a value of null, not returning \"not found\".  That behavior is already available in the existing code.\n\u003e \nSorry, it seems I have not clearly explained our feature in previous comment.\nLet me provide more detail in our feature.\nWith a general ADCSensor config write in baseboard config(mobo.json), we can make url ```/redfish/v1/Chassis/mobo/Sensors/voltage_mobo_battery_p3v``` workable in redfish and return reading is null when sensor is unavailalbe.\n\nAnd then we add a new config Coin_battery.json for another url ```/redfish/v1/Chassis/coin_battery``` in redfish:\n```\n{\n    \"Exposes\": [\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"Name\": \"coin_battery\",\n    \"Probe\": \"FOUND(\u0027mobo\u0027)\",\n    \"Type\": \"Board\",\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nOur feature is to make url ```/redfish/v1/Chassis/coin_battery``` return not found when url ```/redfish/v1/Chassis/mobo/Sensors/voltage_mobo_battery_p3v``` return Reading is null or Status.Health is not OK.\nHowever every sensor\u0027s D-bus have the same interface name and property name, so I add a new interface to make the Probe in Coin_battery.json can be change to ```\"xyz.openbmc_project.BatteryStatus({\u0027Name\u0027: \u0027mobo_battery_p3v\u0027, \u0027Status\u0027: true})\"``` so as to dynamically display information in Coin_battery.json base on adcsensor mobo_battery_p3v sensor\u0027s status.\n\u003e You\u0027re free to do whatever you like in your code tree, but I\u0027m personally not going to support features that go against best practices.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e Thus, I modify the basic sensor class to record the current available, functional and threshold event is trigger or not and update to the property \"Status\" in interface \"xyz.openbmc_project.BatteryStatus\".\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e The config of battery sensor \u0027mobo_battery_p3v\u0027 is added in motherboard\u0027s config.\n\u003e \u003e And add a new coin battery\u0027s config with \"Probe\": ```\"xyz.openbmc_project.BatteryStatus({\u0027Name\u0027: \u0027mobo_battery_p3v\u0027, \u0027Status\u0027: true})\"``` to meet the requirement.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e \u003e Note, there are LOTS of examples of batteries in openbmc ADC entries already, most of which can be found by searching for the BridgeGPIO stanza in the EM configs.  I\u0027m not against having a unique \"battery\" entry for EM that\u0027s unique from ADC, because it\u0027s more descriptive, but the rest of the changes making heavy changes to the base class need to go in the subclass, and we need to document what we\u0027re actually trying to accomplish.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e Got it, I\u0027m not sure if BridgeGPIO is only for battery before.\n\u003e \u003e I think the new sensor type BATTERY is not need anymore.\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e \u003e To reiterate what I said earlier, there is no such thing as a \"Battery\" sensor type.  There is a sensor that produces a voltage.  If it\u0027s monitoring a battery, it needs to be attached to a Battery entry which can be added using a new EM file with Probe \u003d Found(\"My baseboard\").\n\u003e \u003e \n\u003e \u003e I will remove the Battery sensor type and use BridgeGPIO to know whether this sensor is for battery.\n\u003e \n\u003e You\u0027ve missed the point a little.  To be clear, most batteries have ADC sensors that use BridgeGPIO.  BridgeGPIO does not itself indicate that it\u0027s a battery.  indicating that a device is a battery would be done by declaring a new EM file for the battery itself, and setting up a sensor within it.\n\nGot it, we only have a battery sensor require BridgeGPIO, so I\u0027m not sure if there exist some adc sensor require BridgeGPIO but they are not for battery.",
