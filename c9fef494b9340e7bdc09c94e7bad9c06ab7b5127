      "message": "This is essentially duplicating features (thresholding, hysteresis, thermal zones, poll times, ect) that we have already in userspace.  The commit message needs to identify:\n1. Why this is needed over the existing solutions.\n2. When a user would pick one solution over another.\n\nI really suspect this is completely duplicating functionality, which, might be better than what we have, but if it\u0027s better, we should plan on a full transition, and removing the userspace thresholding code entirely for hwmon sensors.",
