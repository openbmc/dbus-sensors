      "message": "As of this patch that would work, but in https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/56023 it also gets used in HwmonTempMain.cpp.  I thought about making it a method like I2CDeviceParams::present(), but that seemed confusing in terms of nomenclature (it\u0027s querying the presence of a device with those parameters, not the parameters themselves, and given the sort of \"dynamically-typed\" nature of the config info the latter is also sort of a potentially reasonable thing to want to check).  I guess it could be I2CDeviceParams::devicePresent() or something to make that a bit clearer...thoughts?  (I don\u0027t presently have a strong opinion here.)",
