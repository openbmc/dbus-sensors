Should this scale based on the number of sensors?\n\nI do find it slightly confusing that the variable is named ‘readThread’ throughout when the type is a thread_pool.  I’d prefer “pool” be part of the name for readability (and potential future maintainance if we ever change this to a number larger than 1).",
