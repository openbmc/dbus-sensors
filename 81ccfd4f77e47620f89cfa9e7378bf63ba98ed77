      "message": "Is 1 sufficient?  Should this scale based on the number of sensors?\n\nI do find it slightly confusing that the variable is named ‘readThread’ throughout when the type is a thread_pool.  I’d prefer “pool” be part of the name for readability (and potential future maintainance if we ever change this to a number larger than 1).",

      "message": "Right, readThreadPool is a better name.\nBut this patch itself is not good enough to be upstream：\n* It has no mutex protection so it has race condition on DBus property\u0027s set/get\n* It requires thread support while the whole dbus-sensors specifically does not use thread at all. So it requires (CMakefile before and now) meson.build changes to enable the thread support only for psusensor.\n\nI will abandon this patch.",
