The problem is that dbus-sensor adds all sensors into association. \n\nThat\u0027s not really a \"problem\" that\u0027s by design.\n\n\u003e By the use of phosphor-virtual-sensor, sensors that are used in the formation for virtual sensors should not be added into association and this change support the option to remove the sensor added to association.\n\nAgain.... this needs a design doc for exactly the reason you\u0027ve pointed out.  the Sensor interfaces are spread across many different repositories, and will all need updated if we were able to \"hide\" sensors, although I suspect my personal opinion is that we shouldn\u0027t be hiding sensor values at all.",
