      "message": "Hmm. I like the idea, but as you said, there are other concerns that you mentioned later that should also be taken into account.\n\nI also have these old patches:\n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/dbus-sensors/+/41453\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/intel-ipmi-oem/+/41524\n\nThese were along the same idea, and they worked as a set, but they didn\u0027t get polished enough to be accepted.\n\nYou mentioned freeform string, D-Bus path, and HTTP URL. Is there a doc that has the recommended escaping for preventing data loss throughout all of these conversion paths?",
