Whenever i prefix a comment with `nit:` it\u0027s a nitpick and probably not super important to me.\n\nShould i mark the comment as resolved in those cases?\n\nI find nits can be useful to improve the patch if the author makes another revision due to other reason. In that case they can address the nitpicks as well since they are already uploading a new revision anyways.",
