      "message": "thermal_zone0 is a linux naming convention?  What does \"thermal_zoneN\" convey in terms of the hardware?  Are there reasons why I user would set different thermal parameters for each zone?  For that matter, is there a reason a user would set different BMC thermal parameters for a given system?  I assume that a given BMC model (that we know at compile time) would have a known thermal threshold.\n\nMore details here would be great.",

      "message": "Now we only use thermal zone to monitor BMC CPU themperature, but the thermal zone may be used for other on DIE thermal sensors. I even think we may not need two thermal (zone) sensors in the BMC, but I think it may be an example for configure mutiple thermal_zone type sensors with BMCOnDieThermalSensor.",

      "message": "This doesn\u0027t really answer my question though.  \"thermal zone\" is a linux naming convention, which we explicitly try to avoid in config files, and also has problematic naming because of the fact that \"thermal zone\" could also mean the zones we use to configure fans.  What I\u0027m trying to understand is:\n\n1. Do these thermal zones need to be configurable per-platform?  Or are they determined by the SOC?\n2. If yes, how would a user determine how many \"thermal zones\" they need or want?\n3. Is any of this auto-detectable based on the SOC (aspeed, nuvoton, ect) we\u0027re using, so we can have reasonable defaults for users that don\u0027t configure these thermal zones?",
