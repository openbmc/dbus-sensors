      "message": "@akurdunkar@nvidia.com you need to do some rephrasing here. What you are handling here is to make sure there is only one outstanding request message to a GPU device implementing the VDM protocol, as that is a VDM protocol restriction (and not an MCTP restriction).\n\nHandling out of order packets/messages, sending to the correct recipient etc. is MCTP scope and handled by the kernel. You are not doing any of these here, so simplify the commit message to match the code.",
