      "message": "in my mind, there\u0027s no reason to mix together queuing and the request response cycle. We should be able to keep mctprequester in its current (much improved) form and have the queueing stuff just deal with queueing and calling back to the client. It can hand an internal callback to the mctprequester and deal with when to tell mctprequester to do its thing. When its contract to the client is satisfied, it will call the \"top level callback\" to the client saying \"done\".",
