      "message": "I don\u0027t think we should change this boolean, which represents that this device was probed by instantiateDevices(). But hasLabelPowerState() should be a condition next to `if (activateOnly \u0026\u0026 !findI2CDev-\u003esecond.second)`, like `if (activateOnly \u0026\u0026 (!findI2CDev-\u003esecond.second || hasLabelPowerState(*baseConfig)))`. That means the device was already probed before and the sensor was there, but needs to be re-activated.\n\nBut I wonder why this condition passes`https://github.com/openbmc/dbus-sensors/blob/02c4366be0eb2409c81784c989dfb690cd41af58/src/DeviceMgmt.hpp#L138` when the deactived sensor has `isActive() \u003d\u003d false`. Otherwise, the device will be instantiated again and has `findI2CDev-\u003esecond.second \u003d\u003d true` \u003d\u003e then be able to pass your condition.",
