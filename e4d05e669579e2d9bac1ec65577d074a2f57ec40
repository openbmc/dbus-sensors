I\u0027m not sure if it is better to add a feature in class Sensor and make all type of sensor be able to modify PollRate.\n\nThat\u0027s fine, but I think you misunderstood me.  You didn\u0027t use this variable to actually adjust the poll rate, you just added it to the struct.  This needs to initialize waitTimer.\n\nI\u0027d like to keep each sensor types wait timer local, as there tends to be sensor-specific changes (like power state monitoring) that needs to adjust the timer on a per-type basis.",
