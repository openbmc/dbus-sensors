However:\n\nI\u0027d *much* prefer we query compatible attribute through the of_node symlink instead of using arbitrary driver name voodoo. As such it\u0027s not really a comment against this patch specifically as it just follows the pattern of the existing code, but I still think we can do better. I\u0027d prefer we fix the approach first and *then* add support for the GXP fan controller using the fixed approach.\n\nThat said, it\u0027s also concerning that we need to know the type of the fan controller...",

I suspect what we care about is the controller\u0027s association with specific fans in the cooling zone topology, not whether it\u0027s a controller in the SoC or hanging off some I2C bus?",
