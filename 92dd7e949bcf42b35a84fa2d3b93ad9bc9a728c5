Is the expected configuration (what keys can be in the config, etc.) mentioned in an openbmc/codeconstruct design document?\n\nAre we going to document the configuration D-Bus interface?\n\nEDIT: I see that https://github.com/CodeConstruct/mctp/pull/17#issuecomment-1963187104 answers some of the questions above, but I think it would be good to update the commit message here/or add an openbmc design doc, and document the configuration D-Bus API.",
