      "message": "The yv4 system is like `BMC \u003c-\u003e MCTP_device1 \u003c-\u003e MCTP_device2`. The `MCTP_device1` is served as a MCTP bridge and also a MCTP endpoint. In this situation, The `AssignEndpoint` cannot be send to MCTP_device2.\n\nWe observed that there is a command call `Allocate Endpoints` defined in DSP0236. However, it doesn\u0027t seem like we can allocate static endpoints.\n\nDo you have any suggestion on this kind of system?",
