I have never done that before, can you elaborate?\n\nMaybe I should have put it this way \"The sensor configs that have been used won\u0027t be checked again during the current createSensors().\" I think if sensor configs change, the sensor will get re-inited as long as createSensors() is re-entered.",

If there are multiple and according to the old logic the last entry for a certain object_path  overwrites the prior sensorConfigurations in the end, we could start the looping from the back rather than the front in my change. Do you see any need to pursue that or should I just abandon this change?",
