      "message": "This feels like a work-around for a failure in the current design in that it misses an explicit representation of a device instance. It seems unfortunate that we have to go through the dance below to get correct behaviour.\n\nI don\u0027t have a good picture in my head of the impact on the current code of fixing it. Any feelings on that front?\n\nEssentially we\u0027d need sensors to be aggregated in a device, and then to call destroy() on the device. From there run this loop moves internal to the device implementation to tear down its sensors and the logic becomes self-contained.",
