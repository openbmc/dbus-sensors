That needs a lot more detail in your commit message to make that clear.  Also, \"Bus\" thusfar refers to the local BMC bus that the controller is present on.  LIke we talked about this, needs to be called something like RemoteBus.",

It sounds like this is called HostSMBusIndex, which is also fine.  This kind of detail needs to be in your commit message with descriptions of what the parameter does, and what it\u0027s intended to control, because this patchset doesn\u0027t add an implementation, so it\u0027s quite difficult to discern its usage from this patch.",
