      "message": "The final piece of the puzzle is that with the change in exception handling we don\u0027t actually need the std::optional any more, as the exception skips over the code that requires fileHandle be properly initialised in the event of a failure. We can just use\n\n FileHandle fileHandle(devpath);\n\nSorry that my waffle about std::optional behaviour and performance distracted from the changes I was asking you to make. And apologies ongoing back-and-forth.\n\nI think with this last adjustment we can get it merged.",
