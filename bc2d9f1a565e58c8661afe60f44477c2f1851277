      "message": "The issue observed is that this timer works (delays for 10s before handler is called) with service that is build without io_uring enabled (EPOLL is enabled). It does not work (handler is called right after with no delay of 10S) in service that is build with io_uring enabled (EPOLL is disabled) like fansensor service.\nI believe that is caused by static library utils.a is build without uring_args (ie EPOLL backend) but service executable target is build with EPOLL disabled.",
