      "message": "The issue observed is that this timer works (delays for 10s before handler is called) with service that is build without io_uring enabled (EPOLL is enabled). It does not work (handler is called right after with no delay of 10S) in service that is build with io_uring enabled (EPOLL is disabled) like fansensor service.\nI believe that is caused by static library utils.a is build without uring_args (ie EPOLL backend) but service executable target is build with EPOLL disabled.",

      "message": "No concern, consistency feels like the expected approach. But perhaps it\u0027s best to make that argument in the commit message before talking about the bug? \"We saw the bug below as a result of this inconsistency\" is fair enough after talking about the consistency problem. Saying \"solves a bug\" without talking about consistency immediately rings alarm bells because of the disconnect between the problem and the fix, and lack of explanation of the root cause.",
