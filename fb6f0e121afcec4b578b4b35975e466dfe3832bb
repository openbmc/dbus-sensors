So 1.0 would induce an offset of 1 volt, -1.0 would reduce the output by 1 volt.\n\nAlso, generally 3.3V batteries don\u0027t have an offset in comparison with the onboard ADC, so this seems a bit odd to see.  You might want to verify that\u0027s what you intended.\n\nNote: see below, I commented on your math equation where it needs to change.",
