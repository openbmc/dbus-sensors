      "message": "This is a great idea. I have long been in favor of having more than one readout, one for the user-desired setting, versus another for the hardware-actual setting. The reason is that of fan lag, as you mentioned, and other things such as sensor value quantization. I thought there was an open GitHub issue for this feature request, but there wasn\u0027t. It\u0027s a good idea. Thanks for adding it.",
