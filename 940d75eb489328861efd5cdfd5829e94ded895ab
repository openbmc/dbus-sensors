Are these stripped? You could massage the meson to install the tests and then use `meson install --strip` to sort them out. It might also be worth building with `meson setup -Dbuildtype\u003drelease` to see if there\u0027s much difference.\n\n\u003e when there are so many tests that it takes too long or output becomes too big\nthen one could think about making a commandline option to only run some suites.\n\nWell, they do appear to be gtests so we can already slice-and-dice them on the command line:\n\nhttps://google.github.io/googletest/advanced.html#running-test-programs-advanced-options\n\nI guess I\u0027m not terribly fussed about the one binary.
