      "message": "LGTM, although I\u0027ve never been a huge fan of how the lifetime of the nvme sensor polling works, and it\u0027s very hard to review for correctness, but this does look correct.  One minor language thing if you want to fix it, but I\u0027m not that worried about it.",

      "message": "One other note;  The \"only poll one sensor at a time\" thing was important before we had the real mctp bindings in the kernel, because the userspace libmctp implementation wasn\u0027t reentrant safe.  Now that we have the kernel bindings, I suspect we could move this to the model we have elsewhere, where each sensor scans independently on its own timer loop, and has its own handle to the bus, which would simplify this stuff a lot.\n\nJust food for thought.",
