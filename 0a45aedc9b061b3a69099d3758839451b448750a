      "message": "Sure! Yeah I can go resurrect that: I guess I just wonder, what would be the best place for the code to live. It could be added directly in dbus-sensors, but it might be more appropriate to create an openbmc/omnisensor fork. Idk, not that important, more important that I actually just go try using it for some stuff and extending it, and then incorporate it into a machine image in openbmc/openbmc for demonstration purposes.",

It\u0027s rough, needs some work before merge, but might get us what we need.  Nothing against rust, I just don\u0027t know it well enough to review.",

I really do want to see it succeed, but even Zev seems to have dropped it at this point.  Could really use motivated people to break it out and start using it in a real production capacity.",
