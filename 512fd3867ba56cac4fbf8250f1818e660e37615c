      "message": "Is there an actual use case where this can happen, or is this hypothetical?\n\nConsidering that a sensor being reconstructed means that the sensor was either removed (through a hardware removal) or a threshold was changed, both of which are manual inputs by the user, it seems just fine that the thresholds deassert without a log message.  In the case where the sensor has been created and destroyed, there should be a log of the sensors removal, but I wouldn\u0027t expect there to be forced assert when the configuration changes.",
