Is this still desired?\n\nYes, the affected code wasn\u0027t modified since then so it\u0027s still needed if one wants to have PECI-provided thresholds for the temperature. If this feature is not needed at all it should be removed altogether as it\u0027s currently broken without this patch.\n\nPlease keep in mind that PECI is an unreliable transport especially so during host bootup (also during host relatively deep states).",

If I am to handle it, what would be the action to take? I\u0027d say it still warrants termination of the proocess, and default action on uncaught exception is exactly that, it also prints `what()` automatically so provides useful diagnostics.\n\nPlease note that \"No filesystem exception is thrown if object does not exist (use return value).\" I wrote and tested this code snippet, it was necessary for the changes made to PECI temperature daemon here. It didn\u0027t throw any exceptions (why would it for sysfs ever?).",
