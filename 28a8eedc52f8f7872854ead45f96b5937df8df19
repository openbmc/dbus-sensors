How are these OEM commands invoked from the config file (those details might also be in your EM commit).\n\nWhen these are translated, what versions exist?  Why are these important?  Where are the OEM commands for these things defined?  If they\u0027re not defined anywhere outside of this, a basic prototype of their usage would be good.  You somewhat tried to do that in the \"Version Format\" section below, but more detail there would be good to add for others trying to add their own flavor of OEM ipmi commands.",
