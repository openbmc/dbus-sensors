There are cases where nvme drives lose their mind, and disappear for a while (firmware update being one case, but there are others).  In those cases, we would never resume scanning when the drive \"shows up\" again.  I think it would help a lot if your commit message could mention why you want to do this;  Saving CPU cycles?  Long timeouts on failed operations blocking other reads?\n\nIf it\u0027s one of those, we could drop the scan rate significantly if the sensor goes into failure, but I don\u0027t think we should abandon it altogether.",
