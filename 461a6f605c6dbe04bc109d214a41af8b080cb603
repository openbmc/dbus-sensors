If the name can now include spaces, bmcweb needs to ensure that the URI is being encoded.  so in practice, we also need to make sure the redfish tree is walkable and sane.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e I will do a more detailed system integration tests.\n\u003e \n\u003e Redfish: RedfishValidator\n\nThat would work.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e IPMI: ipmisdr with dynamic sensor stack.\n\nalso an \"IPMI sensor list\" and make sure that the names of the sensors are correct.
