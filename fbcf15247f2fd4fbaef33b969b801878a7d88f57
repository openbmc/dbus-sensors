      "message": "Can you please break this refactor up into smaller changes that are more easily consumable? For instance, from what I can gather ,there\u0027s a bunch of code motion moving functions between files and such. It would be nice if that kind of problem were separated out so that the patch re-architecting the functionality has minimal noise.",
