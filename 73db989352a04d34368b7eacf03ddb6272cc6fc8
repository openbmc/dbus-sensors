There\u0027s no need to do it every time a VR is changed.\n\nI\u0027m a little worried that this change is going to cover up real failures in a production scenario.  By design, PSUSensor intends to \"OWN\" the VR, so if that\u0027s not true, the design is going to be problematic.  Given that PSUsensor is \"in charge\" of the VR, I\u0027d expect at least some kind of control handoff that\u0027s more robust than \"the FD returned an error\".",

By simply restarting the sensor whenever it goes awol, it hides any real errors.\n\nDon\u0027t quite follow. If you\u0027re talking about the part where we restart PSUSensors - we only do that because PSUSensors doesn\u0027t deal well with a /sys/class/hwmon/**/ path disappearing and then reappearing. This patch would make it so that you no longer have to restart PSUSensors to achieve this behavior.\n\nIf you\u0027re talking about unbinding/rebinding drivers to hide errors - that\u0027s not what the use-case is about. We\u0027re unbinding drivers to allow a hardware test have exclusive access to the device and rebinding them to give the device back to PSUSensors.",
