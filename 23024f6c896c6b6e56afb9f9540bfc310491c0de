      "message": "I considered that, though after remembering that it\u0027s scoped within the BridgeGpio config key as a sibling to (the otherwise fairly generically-named) Name and Polarity I figured that in practice it would be pretty clear that it\u0027s referring to the enable time of the GPIO, not the sensor itself.\n\nThe other related thought I had is w.r.t. naming and units -- PollRate is in float seconds, so maybe it\u0027d be nice to have this match that as well, and drop the `Ms` suffix?  Though to be honest I think PollRate isn\u0027t the best name for it; something like PollInterval would be a lot more descriptive IMO.\n\nThoughts?",
