      "message": "I considered that, though after remembering that it\u0027s scoped within the BridgeGpio config key as a sibling to (the otherwise fairly generically-named) Name and Polarity I figured that in practice it would be pretty clear that it\u0027s referring to the enable time of the GPIO, not the sensor itself.\n\nThe other related thought I had is w.r.t. naming and units -- PollRate is in float seconds, so maybe it\u0027d be nice to have this match that as well, and drop the `Ms` suffix?  Though to be honest I think PollRate isn\u0027t the best name for it; something like PollInterval would be a lot more descriptive IMO.\n\nThoughts?",

      "message": "Couple ideas: holdTime, setupTime, settleTimer. I don\u0027t really have a strong preference.\nI am ok with this being an integer and use Ms to hint it is in ms. Like you pointed out it is defined within BridgeGpio and not for \"sensor\". We really don\u0027t need precision (or even achieve) of a floating point. IMO, PollRate can be integer using ms also.",
