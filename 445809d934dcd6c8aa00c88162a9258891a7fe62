Generally the BMC is able to increase the PSU fan speed, to avoid weird pressure pockets within the case.  I\u0027d double check with your thermal designers to make sure that\u0027s not required on your system, but if it\u0027s not, simply removing it seems like a good option.\n\n\u003e We probably do need to remove the pwm sensor in such case.",
